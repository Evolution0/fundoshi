Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Which python version?
----------------------

Although Fundoshi is written with python 3+ compatibility in mind, it is only
tested in 3.3 and 3.4. Use other python3 versions at your own risk.

Why not python2 you ask? See the official recommendation:

    Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.

**Do not** let naysayers spread FUD around python3. **Stop** producing new
legacy code. Embrace progress.


Why name it "Fundoshi"?
-----------------------

Because I can. How many projects can you find named after a piece of Japanese
traditional male undergarment/swimwear?
