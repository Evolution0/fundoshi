Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Which python version?
----------------------

Fundoshi is tested on Python 3.4 and 3.5.

Why not support python2 you ask? Two reasons:

- Principal: I hate legacy code, and python2 is, `by definition
  <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3>`_, legacy.
- Practicality: See `python3 readiness <http://py3readiness.org/>`_.

**Do not** let naysayers spread FUD around python3. **Stop** producing new
legacy code. Embrace progress.


Why name it "Fundoshi"?
-----------------------

Because I can.
